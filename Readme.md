# Welcome to the Beer Parser CLI Tool

This code was created as a recruitment task for one of companies I have worked for.


### Before using:

  * make sure that `install` and `do` are executable.
  * make sure that `tmp` dir is writable.
  
  
### Installing

  Just run `./install` in project root.
  
  It shall install composer dependencies.
